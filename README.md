## Overview

This repository contains a computational text analysis project focused on the representation and sentiment of LGBTQIA+ identities in the ecology and evolution (eco/evo) scholarly literature. The goal is to systematically examine how queer identities and behaviors—both in organisms and in language—are framed across time in peer-reviewed journals, using natural language processing (NLP), keyword-in-context (KWIC) analysis, and sentiment detection.
